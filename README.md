# Nora : C++ Chess Engine

Chess engine developed in C++23. The goal of the project is to see how much I have improved since writting my previous engine [LINKcs](https://github.com/Woldbye/LINKcs) in C\#.

## Specifications

* C++23
* Docker Compose
* Header only library
* UCI-protocl <!-- TODO Add reference to API -->

## API

Nora communicates through the UCI-protocol, and as such can be run in any GUI that implements this protocol (etc. [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/)).
